## Welcome to blip.

Targeting amateur videographers and filmmakers looking for a platform to organize their many ideas and keep track of projects, viDoc is designed to streamline the creative process, providing space to take notes, compose shotlists, and eventually, organize ideas visually on a graphic timeline.

### State of viDoc (updated 9/30)

As of Monday, 2/24, blip is in early stages of development, not yet deployed to Vercel. We expect to have a baseline working version deployed by May at the latest.

### Ideation

This app came about as a result of the realization that we, as car enthusiasts, have no real central resource to find if there are any nearby/upcoming car enthusiast shows and meets, known to the community as "cars and coffee" events. Looking through Reddit threads, Facebook forums, and Instagram pages can be tedious and community centers can be hard to find.

We hope that this map can become this central resource for carspotters around the country(but California for now) to rely on to find cool events near them. 

### To-Dos

Some ideas of possible additions/changes to blip that are in consideration.

- [High Priority] Add, create and delete events
- [High Priority] Google maps links on event posts
- Map searchbar
- Attach images to events

### Tech Stack

- Our tech stack consists of TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Supabase, along with the HeroUI library.
- The project will be hosted by Vercel.
