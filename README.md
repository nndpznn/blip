## Welcome to blip.

The race might be a drag, but finding them doesn't have to be!

This app came about as a result of the realization that we, as car enthusiasts, have no real central resource to find if there are any nearby/upcoming car enthusiast shows and meets, known to the community as "cars and coffee" events. Looking through Reddit threads, Facebook forums, and Instagram pages can be tedious and community centers can be hard to find.

We hope that this map can become this central resource for carspotters around the country(but California for now) to rely on to find cool events near them. 

### State of blip (updated 2/24)

As of Monday, 2/24, blip is in early stages of development, not yet deployed to Vercel. We expect to have a baseline working version deployed by May at the latest.

### To-Dos

Some ideas of possible additions/changes to blip that are in consideration.

- [High Priority] Add, create and delete events
- [High Priority] Google maps links on event posts
- Map searchbar
