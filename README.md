## Welcome to blip.

The race might be a drag, but finding them doesn't have to be!

This app came about as a result of the realization that we, as car enthusiasts, have no real central resource to find if there are any nearby/upcoming car shows, meets, or even "cars and coffee"s! Digging through Reddit threads, Facebook forums, and Instagram pages can be tedious and community centers can be hard to find.

We hope that this map can become this central resource for carspotters around the country(but California for now) to rely on to find cool events near them. 

### State of blip (updated 9/15/2025)

As of Monday, 9/15, blip has made great progress but is still missing key functionality regarding the map. It is not yet deployed to Vercel. We expect to have a baseline working version deployed by January.

### To-Dos

Some ideas of possible additions/changes to blip that are in consideration.

- [High Priority] Meets shown on map
- User profile pages
- 
- Google maps links on event posts
- 

### Tech Stack

- Our tech stack consists of TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Supabase, along with the HeroUI library.
- The project will be hosted by Vercel.
