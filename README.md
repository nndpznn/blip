## Welcome to blip.

The race might be a drag, but finding them doesn't have to be.

Welcome to blip, your new companion for finding nearby cars and coffee events and meets from community leaders. This app came about as a result of the realization that we, as car enthusiasts, have no real central resource to find if there are any nearby/upcoming car enthusiast shows and meets. Looking through Tiktok, Reddit threads, Facebook forums, and Instagram pages can be tedious and community centers can be hard to find. We hope that this map can become this central resource for carspotters around the country(but California for now) to rely on to find cool events near them.

### State of blip (updated 1/25/2026)

As of Sunday, 1/25, blip is certainly on its way!! There is a lot of cleaning up to do regarding user experience flows, code efficiency, etc. but we are extremely proud to share that key functionality is complete. It is not yet deployed to Vercel, but we expect to have a baseline working version deployed by March.

### To-Dos

Improvements to blip that are in progress.

- Fleshed-out user profile page
- Logged-out user flow
- Map page

### Tech Stack

- Our tech stack consists of TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Supabase, along with the HeroUI library.
- The project will be hosted by Vercel.
